*Every student in a given section of Math in Context I 
would also be enrolled in a common section of the CG 
course.  The instructors of a given pair of courses 
would work in a collaborative fashion and ideally visit 
one another's classes, especially the first week. 

Unlinked sections of the CG course would be offered 
for entry level DE mathematics students whose initial 
placement is `above' Math in Context I.  Students who 
pass Math in Context I but not the attendant CG course 
might be required to retake the course.
